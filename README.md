# data_analysis_project_I

This is a capstone project that was done at the end of my data analysis and visualisation certification conducted in Strathmore University on July 2025. This was a 2 month program that covered business intelligence, statistics, python, pandas, numpy and advanced visualisations. The capstone project showcased here is proof of knowledge and understanding. 

The study I conducted was on PCOS given that September was PCOS awareness month and it felt necessary to conduct my study on it. 

DATA SOURCING
The data used was retrieved from kaggle and is attached in the repository. I included both the csv sheet and the data description for any references that one may need to make.

DATA PREPROCESSING
To conduct my study efficiently, the data needed some preprocessing but not much. What took more effort was the study of the data and what it meant in the realm of PCOS. I had to understand the relevance and significance of every data point in order to conduct effective research. This data study aided in better data preprocessing. This included renaming wrongly named fields and dropping fields that were recorded using the wrong unit of measure. 

STUDY
I broke down my study into case studies which were tied to research questions and hypothesis. Moreover, every case study was concluded with a few comments on the results I was getting and an explanation on what was happening. My study needed categorical data for better analysis hence the simple encoding through creation of new fields. For analysis based on the various case studies I have, given the binary categorical encoding mentioned, I mostly utilised chi-square tests for analysis. I also made an attempt at conducting regression analysis and building a regression model. 

CONCLUSION
Given that this was a project majorly aimed at showcasing my level of understanding, it does not include any major breakthroughs but that doesn't mean I didn't have any. Several models exist and continue to be created for the diagnosis of PCOS but about 70% of women remain undiagnosed, with several misdiagnosis cases being reported especially in black women. Additionally, women's health remains an understudied area. This therefore begs the question on what more we can do especially as data analysts to support the healthcare industry. 

The breakdown of the study can be read either through the notebook or the powerpoint document provided.
